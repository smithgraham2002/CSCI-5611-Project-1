# CSCI-5611-Project-1

Features:
1. Basic Pinball Dynamics: A ball falls down the screen, and accelerates according to gravity.
2. Multiple Balls Interacting: By lighting up all of the circular objects at once, the player can earn multi-ball. More balls are added to the simulation that bounce off of each other.
3. Circular Obstacles: Multiple circles are spread around the board. The player can hit the circles with the ball to light them up.
4. Polygonal Obstacles: There are rectangles on the board that get in the way of the ball as it moves.
5. Textured Background: The board features a custom thematic image.
6. Reactive Obstacles: The circular obstacles light up when hit. When all circles are lit up, multi-ball is unlocked.
7. Score Display: Points are earned by hitting circular obstacles. The points are displayed at the top of the screen.
8. Progressive Objectives: If the three circles in the tiny santa's hat are lit up, a point multiplier is applied. If all of the circles are lit up, multi-ball is unlocked.
9. Pinball Game Mechanics: Flippers are included to keep the ball in play. When all lives are lost, a game over screen is displayed.
